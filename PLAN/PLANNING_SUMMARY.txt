Addresses: LootPickup rendering and memory optimization
Effort: 4-6 hours
Impact: 30-40% performance improvement
Trigger: Frame drops with 20+ items on ground

Key Approaches:
1. Object pooling (simpler, 30-40% improvement)
2. Level of Detail system (additional 20-30%)
3. Batch rendering (if needed, 10-20% more)

Phases: 9 detailed phases from profiling to monitoring
Tools: Profiling, optimization analysis, implementation

────────────────────────────────

PERF_002: COLLISION EFFICIENCY
────────────────────────────────
File: PERF_002_COLLISION_EFFICIENCY.txt (7.1 KB)

Effort: 3-4 hours (grid only) to 9-13 hours (full)
Impact: 40-50% collision overhead reduction
Trigger: Player movement stutters with dense loot

Key Approaches:
1. Spatial partitioning (grid system - recommended)
2. Collision layer consolidation
3. Physics optimization

    - Can be quick fix if needed

================================================================================
KEY QUESTIONS FOR TEAM DISCUSSION
================================================================================

Before Implementation, Decide:

1. MATERIAL INTEGRATION
   Q: How important is crafting economy?
   Q: What's intended farming time?
   Q: Thematic materials per enemy or random?

2. NOTIFICATIONS
   Q: Acceptable notification spam level?
   Q: Audio effects must-have or optional?
   Q: Persistent loot history needed?

3. LEGENDARY WEAPONS
   Q: How many legendary items? (5, 10, 20?)
   Q: Only bosses or elites too?
   Q: How powerful vs regular equipment?

4. PERFORMANCE
   Q: Current performance issues observed?
   Q: Target platform(s) and FPS?
   Q: Max expected items on ground?
