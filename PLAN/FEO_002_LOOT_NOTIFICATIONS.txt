FUTURE ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY #2: LOOT NOTIFICATIONS & MESSAGING
================================================================================

Current State:
- Loot drops silently appear on ground
- No player feedback when loot obtained
- No notifications for rare drops
- No log of drops made
- Limited visual feedback beyond colored pickups

Opportunity:
Create a complete notification system for loot events. This provides:
- Player feedback for actions
- Rare loot excitement (notifications for good drops)
- Visual/audio feedback
- Loot log for record keeping
- Encourages engagement with loot system

QUESTIONS FOR PLANNING
================================================================================

Q: Which rarity tiers warrant notifications?
   - All items? (spammy)
   - Rare+ only? (good feedback)
   - UNCOMMON+ (balance)
   - Recommendation: UNCOMMON+ with config option

Q: Should there be special effects for legendaries?
   - Screen flash?
   - Special sound?
   - Floating text?
   - Recommendation: All of above for legendary

Q: Persistent loot history?
   - Session-only?
   - Save to file?
   - Cloud sync?
   - Recommendation: Session-only (less clutter)

Q: Multiple simultaneous notifications?
   - Stack vertically?
   - Overlap?
   - Queue and show one at a time?
   - Recommendation: Queue with max 3 visible

Q: Audio must-have or nice-to-have?
   - Sound effects significant effort
   - Audio feedback is very rewarding
   - Recommendation: Audio is worth it
